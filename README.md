=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it did not perform the actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. Instead of conducting a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report, the agent engaged in a series of actions related to initiating a subscription request for an investor, which was not part of the user instruction or the ground truth actions. The agent's actions were unrelated to the comprehensive fund management operations across the system as instructed.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: other
  Description: The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant performed actions related to initiating a subscription request for an investor, which was not part of the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the assistant to perform a system monitoring approval lookup and generate a system overview report, which are unrelated to the subscription request actions taken in the trajectory. This indicates a significant deviation from the intended task as per the ground truth.
