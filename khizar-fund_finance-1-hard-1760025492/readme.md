=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it did not perform the actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. Instead of conducting a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report, the agent engaged in onboarding a new investor, creating a portfolio, and sending notifications, which were not part of the required actions. The agent's actions were unrelated to the user instruction of performing comprehensive fund management operations across the system.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: other
  Description: The fault in the trajectory is that the actions taken by the assistant do not align with the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth specifies that the assistant should perform a system monitoring approval lookup and generate a system overview report. However, the trajectory involves onboarding a new investor, creating a portfolio, and sending a notification, which are unrelated to the specified actions in the ground truth. The trajectory does not address the intended system monitoring and reporting tasks.
