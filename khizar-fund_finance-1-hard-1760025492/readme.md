=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it engaged in onboarding an accredited investor and creating a portfolio, which were not part of the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the agent to perform a system monitoring approval lookup and generate a system overview report, which were not addressed in the trajectory. The agent's actions deviated from the intended comprehensive fund management operations across the system as specified in the user instruction.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: other
  Description: The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant engaged in onboarding an accredited investor and creating a portfolio, which are actions unrelated to the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the assistant to perform a system monitoring approval lookup and generate a system overview report, neither of which were addressed in the trajectory. The trajectory's actions do not align with the intended comprehensive fund management operations specified in the ground truth.
