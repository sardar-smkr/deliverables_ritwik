=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it did not perform the actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. Instead of conducting a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report, the agent engaged in onboarding a new investor, creating a portfolio, and sending a notification, which were not part of the required actions. The agent's actions were unrelated to the comprehensive fund management operations across the system as instructed.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: other
  Description: The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant engaged in a series of actions related to onboarding a new investor, creating a portfolio, and sending a notification, none of which were part of the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the assistant to perform system monitoring and generate a system overview report, which were not addressed in the trajectory. The trajectory deviated entirely from the intended actions, focusing instead on tasks unrelated to the user instruction and ground truth.
