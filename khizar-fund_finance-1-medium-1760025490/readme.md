Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault because it did not perform the required actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. Instead of conducting a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report, the agent engaged in a conversation about creating a new subscription and investor profile, which was not part of the instructed task.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: other
  Description: The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant did not perform the actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. Instead of conducting a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report, the assistant engaged in a conversation about creating a new subscription for White Inc. in the Perry LLC Strategic Fund, which was not part of the ground truth actions. The trajectory deviated from the expected task of system monitoring and report generation to an unrelated task of investor onboarding and subscription setup.
