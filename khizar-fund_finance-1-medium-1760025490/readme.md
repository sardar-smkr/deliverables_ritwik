=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault because it failed to perform the actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. Instead of conducting a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report, the agent engaged in an unrelated task of setting up a subscription for White Inc., which was not part of the user instruction or the ground truth actions.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: other
  Description: The trajectory contains a fault of type "other" because it does not align with the ground truth action sequence. The user instruction indicates that the user is a Finance Expert System Administrator with access to all interfaces and needs to perform comprehensive fund management operations. The ground truth action sequence involves performing a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report. However, the trajectory instead focuses on setting up a subscription for White Inc., which involves creating an investor profile and gathering information for a subscription process. This is unrelated to the actions specified in the ground truth, indicating a misalignment between the user's role and the actions taken in the trajectory.
