=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it did not perform the actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the agent to perform a "system_monitoring" approval lookup and generate a "system_overview" report. Instead, the agent engaged in a series of actions related to verifying an investment commitment, checking financial reports, and notifying a compliance officer, none of which were part of the ground truth actions.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: goal_partially_completed
  Description: The trajectory contains a fault of type "goal_partially_completed" because it does not perform the actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth requires two specific actions: "approval_lookup" with the parameters for system monitoring and "generate_report" for a system overview. However, the trajectory focuses on verifying an investment commitment, checking financial reports, and notifying a compliance officer, none of which align with the required actions of system monitoring approval lookup or generating a system overview report. Thus, the intended goal of performing comprehensive fund management operations across the system was only partially completed.
