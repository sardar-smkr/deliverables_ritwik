=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault because it failed to perform the necessary actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the agent to perform a "system_monitoring" approval lookup and generate a "system_overview" report. Instead, the agent engaged in a series of unrelated information retrieval actions about a specific investment, which were not aligned with the comprehensive fund management operations expected from the user instruction. The agent did not execute the required actions to monitor the system or generate the necessary report, leading to a deviation from the expected functional outcome.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: goal_partially_completed
  Description: The trajectory contains a fault of type "goal_partially_completed" because it fails to execute the "approval_lookup" and "generate_report" actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth requires the agent to perform a system monitoring approval lookup and generate a system overview report. However, the trajectory focuses on confirming an investment's completion and its reflection in financial reports, without performing the specified actions. Thus, the trajectory does not fully achieve the intended goal as outlined in the ground truth.
