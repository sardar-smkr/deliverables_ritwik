=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it failed to perform the necessary actions as per the ground truth action sequence. Instead of conducting a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report, the agent engaged in an unrelated task of updating a bond valuation, which was not part of the user's instruction or the ground truth actions. The agent also incorrectly attempted to verify user authorization for an action that was not required, leading to an unnecessary transfer to a human agent.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: other
  Description: The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant did not perform any actions related to the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the assistant to perform a "system_monitoring" approval lookup and generate a "system_overview" report. Instead, the trajectory focused on updating a bond valuation, checking for user authorization, and transferring the user to a human agent, none of which align with the required actions in the ground truth.
