=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it did not perform the actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. Instead of conducting a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report, the agent engaged in updating a bond's market valuation and creating notifications and reports related to that task. The actions taken by the agent were unrelated to the comprehensive fund management operations across the system as instructed.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: used_wrong_tool_argument
  Description: The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant used the wrong tool argument for the `approval_lookup` action. In the ground truth, the `approval_lookup` action is performed with the `action` argument set to `"system_monitoring"` and the `requester_email` set to `"admin@company.com"`. However, in the trajectory, the assistant did not perform the `approval_lookup` action at all, and instead, it incorrectly focused on updating a bond's market valuation, which was not part of the ground truth action sequence. The trajectory diverged from the expected actions by not using the correct tool arguments for the intended system monitoring and report generation tasks.
