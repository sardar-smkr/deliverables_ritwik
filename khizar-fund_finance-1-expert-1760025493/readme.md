=== DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS ===

=== ALL FAULT ASSIGNMENTS (1 total) ===
Task 0: agent fault
  Description: The agent is responsible for the fault because it did not perform the actions specified in the ground truth action sequence. Instead of conducting a system monitoring approval lookup and generating a system overview report, the agent engaged in a fund switching operation, which was not part of the user instruction or the ground truth actions. The agent's actions were unrelated to the task of comprehensive fund management operations across the system as described in the user instruction.


=== ALL FAULT TYPES (1 total) ===
Task 0: other
  Description: The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant engaged in a complex fund switching operation, which was not part of the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required only two actions: an approval lookup for system monitoring and generating a system overview report. The trajectory, however, involved multiple steps related to switching an investor's fund, including checking approvals, canceling and creating subscriptions, recording audit trails, and sending notifications, none of which were necessary according to the ground truth. This indicates a significant deviation from the intended actions.
