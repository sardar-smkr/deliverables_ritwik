Task 0: user fault
  Description: The user is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because they initiated a request to sell shares of Cooper Inc Corp, which is unrelated to the task outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the user to perform system monitoring and generate a system overview report, not to engage in trading activities. The user's instructions and requests led the conversation away from the intended actions of system monitoring and report generation.
